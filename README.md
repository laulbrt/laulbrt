# Hi, I'm Laura Labarthe

I am currently studying Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, and I am actively looking for a **Data / Machine Learning internship starting April 2026**.

I enjoy working on end-to-end data projects: preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model development, and deployment-ready notebooks.  
I have experience with Python, pandas, scikit-learn, numerical methods, and applied machine learning on real datasets.
